update-crypto-policies(8)
=========================
:doctype: manpage
:man source: update-crypto-policies


NAME
----
update-crypto-policies - manage the policies available to the various
cryptographic back-ends.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*update-crypto-policies* ['COMMAND']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
update-crypto-policies(8) is used to set the policy applicable for the
various cryptographic back-ends, such as SSL/TLS libraries. That will
be the default policy used by these back-ends unless the application user
configures them otherwise.

The available policies are restricted to the following profiles.

* LEGACY: ensures maximum compatibility with legacy systems (64-bit
  security)

* DEFAULT: A reasonable default for today's standards (80-bit security).

* FUTURE: A level that will provide security on a conservative level that is
  believed to withstand any near-term future attacks (112-bit security).

* EMPTY: All cryptographic algorithms are disabled (used for debugging only)

The desired system policy is selected in /etc/crypto-policies/config
and this tool will generate the individual policy requirements for
all back-ends that support such configuration. After this tool is called
the administrator is assured that any application that utilizes the
supported back-ends will follow a policy that adheres to the configured profile.

Note that the above assurance does apply to the extend that applications
are configured to follow the default policy (the details vary on the back-end, see below
for more information).

The generated back-end policies will be placed in /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends.
Currently the supported back-ends are:

* GnuTLS library

* OpenSSL library

* NSS library

* OpenJDK

* Libkrb5

* BIND

* OpenSSH

[[options]]
OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available in update-crypto-policies tool.

* --show:       Shows the currently applied crypto policy

* --is-applied: Returns success if the currently configured policy is
                already applied.

* --no-check:   By default this tool does a sanity check on whether the configured policy
                is accepted by the supported tools. This option disables those checks.

* --set:        Sets the current policy and overwrites the config file.


[[appsupport]]
APPLICATION SUPPORT
-------------------
Applications shipped by Fedora that provide a default configuration file
that includes a cryptographic policy string will be modified gradually to
support these policies.

When an application provides a configuration file, the changes needed to
utilize the system-wide policy are the following.

* Applications using GnuTLS: If an application allows the configuration of
  cipher priotities via a string, the special priority string "@SYSTEM" should replace
  any other priority string. Applications which use the default library
  settings automatically adhere to the policy. 
  Applications following the policy inherit the settings for cipher suite preference, TLS
  and DTLS protocol versions, allowed elliptic curves, and limits for
  cryptographic keys.

* Applications using OpenSSL: If an application allows the configuration of
  ciphersuite string, the special cipher string "PROFILE=SYSTEM" should replace any other cipher string.
  Applications which use the default library settings automatically adhere to the policy.
  Applications following the policy inherit the settings for cipher suite preference.

* Applications using NSS: Applications using NSS will load the crypto policies by
  default. They inherit the settings for cipher suite preference, TLS
  and DTLS protocol versions, allowed elliptic curves, and limits for
  cryptographic keys. Note that unlike OpenSSL and GnuTLS, the NSS policy
  is enforced by default; to prevent applications from adhering
  to the policy the NSS_IGNORE_SYSTEM_POLICY environment variable must be set to 1
  prior to executing that application.

* Applications using Java: No special treatment is required. Applications using
  Java will load the crypto policies by default.
  These applications will then inherit the settings for allowed cipher suites,
  allowed TLS and DTLS protocol versions, allowed elliptic curves, and limits for
  cryptographic keys. To prevent openjdk applications from adhering
  to the policy the `<java.home>/jre/lib/security/java.security` file should
  be edited to contain `security.useSystemPropertiesFile=false`.
  Alternatively one can create a file containing the overridden values for
  'jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms', 'jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms' and pass
  the location of that file to Java on the command line using the 
  `-Djava.security.properties=<path to file>`.

* Applications using libkrb5: No special treatment is required. Applications
  will follow the crypto policies by default. These applications inherit the
  settings for the permitted encryption types for tickets as well as the
  cryptographic key limits for the PKINIT protocol. A system-wide opt-out is
  available by deleting the /etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies link.

 * BIND: This application inherits the set of blacklisted algorithms. To
   opt-out from the policy, remove the policy include directive in the
   named.conf file.

 * OpenSSH: Both server and client application inherits the cipher preferences,
   the key exchange algorithms as well as the GSSAPI key exchange algorithms.
   To opt-out from the policy for client, override the global ssh_config with a
   user-specific configuration in ~/.ssh/config. See ssh_config(5) for more
   information.
   To opt-out from the policy for server, remove the line containing
   {INCLUDE_CRYPTO_POLICY} substitution string from sshd_config. See
   shd_config(5) for more information.


[[policyconfig]]
POLICY CONFIGURATION
--------------------
One of the supported profiles should be set in /etc/crypto-policies/config
and this script should be run afterwards.

In case of a parsing error no policies will be updated.

FILES
-----
/etc/crypto-policies/config::
	The file contains the current system policy. It should contain a string of one of the profiles listed above (e.g., DEFAULT).

/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends::
	Contains the generated policies in separated files, and in a format readable by the supported back-ends.

/etc/crypto-policies/local.d::
	Contains additional files to be appended to the generated policy
	files. The files present must adhere to $app-XXX.config file naming, where
	XXX is any arbitrary identifier. For example, to append a line to
	GnuTLS' generated policy, create a gnutls-extra-line.config file in
	local.d. This will be appended to the generated gnutls.config during
	update-crypto-policies.
