fips-mode-setup(8)
==================
:doctype: manpage
:man source: fips-mode-setup


NAME
----
fips-mode-setup - Check, enable, or disable the system FIPS mode.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*fips-mode-setup* ['COMMAND']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
fips-mode-setup(8) is used to check and control the system FIPS mode.

When enabling the system FIPS mode the command completes the installation
of FIPS modules if needed by calling 'fips-finish-install' and changes the
system crypto policy to FIPS.

Then the command modifies the boot loader configuration to add
'fips=1' and 'boot=<boot-device>' options to the kernel command line.

When disabling the system FIPS mode the system crypto policy is switched
to DEFAULT and the kernel command line option 'fips=0' is set.

* --enable:     Enables the system FIPS mode.

* --disable:    Disables the system FIPS mode.

* --check:      Checks the system FIPS mode status.

* --no-bootcfg: The tool will not attempt to change the boot loader
                configuration and it just prints the options that need
                to be added to the kernel command line.
